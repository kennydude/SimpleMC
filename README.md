# SimpleMC

Simple Media Centre. Designed for Raspberry Pi*

* Includes OSX support

##Â Why

XMBC is too complex for what I want. I want lightweight + nice config!

## Setup

Depending on the OS you want to run on you may need different applications installed.

* Raspberry Pi
  * fbi (`sudo apt-get install fbi`)
  * omxplayer [Available here](http://omxplayer.sconde.net/)
* OSX
  * VLC (QuickTime is difficult to control; VLC is bad enough)

## RUN!!!

`node app.js` go to http://localhost:3000 (or per IP address)
